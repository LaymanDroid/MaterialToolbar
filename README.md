# MaterialToolbar
An empty Android Studio project with basic Material Design Appcompat in place. Meant to be used as a starting point for students of "Become an Android Developer from Scratch" by The Delta Program at UDEMY.

colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark and colorAccent are in place for Lollipop and pre-Lollipop.

Clone/Fork as much as you want. No Merging with Main Branch.

Have fun!
