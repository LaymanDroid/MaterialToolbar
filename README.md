# Material Toolbar

An empty Android Studio project with basic Material Design Appcompat in place. Meant to be used as a starting point for students of "[Become an Android Developer from Scratch]" by The Delta Program at UDEMY.

Project contains AppCompat Theme.Material with the following attributes
  - colorPrimary
  - colorPrimaryDark
  - colorAccent
  - navigationBarColor (v21 only)

Clone/Fork as much as you want. No Merging with Main Branch.

Have fun!
